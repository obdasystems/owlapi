 * specify that a set of classes are mutually disjoint. Unfortunately, this must be represented in
 * RDF as a set of pairwise disjoint statements. In other words, DisjointClasses(A, B, C) must be
 * represented as DisjointWith(A, B), DisjointWith(A, C) DisjointWith(B, C). ~This test case ensure
 * that these axioms are serialsed correctly.
